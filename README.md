# 🕹️ Ta-Te-Ti in C++

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project was one of my first encounters with the C++ programming language, completed as an optional practical assignment for my Software Development degree. It was a good opportunity to test my skills and knowledge in C++.

### 🎮 Project Details
The project involved implementing the game "Ta-Te-Ti" in the console using C++. I learned a lot during the process, from the basic syntax of the language to how to structure a project and work with arrays and loops for game logic.

**Although some time has passed since I completed this project, I still recognize its importance in my development as a programmer and how it helped me improve my C++ skills.**
